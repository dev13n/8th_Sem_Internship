# 8th Semester Internship at Linde - IT Department (December 16, 2024 to April 15, 2025)

Welcome to my internship repository! I'm currently working as an intern in the IT department at **Linde**, a global leader in industrial gases and engineering. This repository will document my journey and daily tasks during my internship from **December 16, 2024**, to **April 15, 2025**. 

## Daily Tasks

### Week 1: Introduction to Linde and IT Department 🏢

#### Day 1: Monday, 16/12/2024
- **Introduction to Linde**: I was introduced to the company, its values, and its global impact in the industrial gases sector 🌍.
- **Team Introduction**: Met the members of the IT department and the fellow intern I'll be collaborating with. We received an overview of the team's role in supporting Linde's global operations. Additionally, we discussed our technical strengths, current projects, and potential ideas that could be developed into projects for us to work on. 💻.
- **HR Setup**: Completed essential HR-related tasks, including onboarding, and receiving necessary work materials such as ID card and gate pass 📝.
- **Campus Tour**: A guided tour around the Linde campus to familiarize myself with the workspace and facilities 🏫.

#### Day 2: Tuesday, 17/12/2024
- **Tuesday Toolbox Meeting**: Attended the morning "Tuesday Toolbox" meeting, which lasted for 15 minutes. We discussed Linde's company culture and explored ways to implement these values within our daily work life and projects 🤝.
- **Linde Credentials**: Received our official Linde credentials, which included login access and necessary documentation to get started with our tasks 🔑.
- **Familiarization with Projects**: Got introduced to the current projects within the IT department, including software tools and system optimizations ⚙️.
- **Initial Task Assignment**: Assigned to assist with [specific project or task] 🚀.

#### Day 3: Wednesday, 18/12/2024
- **Project Discussion with Supervisor**: Had a detailed discussion with our supervisor to redefine the project ideas, identifying potential challenges and brainstorming initial solutions for addressing them 🧠.
- **Dataset Research**: Conducted research to find relevant datasets that can be leveraged for the project, exploring various sources and evaluating their suitability 📊.
- **Data Engineering Solutions**: Provided data engineering solutions for certain aspects of the project, helping to streamline the data pipeline and optimize processes 🛠️.

#### Day 4: Thursday, 19/12/2024  
- **Python Libraries and Dependencies**: Created a detailed list of Python libraries and their specific versions to be used in the project, explaining the rationale behind choosing certain versions for compatibility and stability. Included libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Matplotlib for data analysis, machine learning, and visualization 📚.
- **Temporary Plan of Action**: Outlined a preliminary action plan for the next stages of the project, defining clear tasks and milestones for upcoming days. The plan focuses on setting up the environment, data preprocessing, and model selection 🔧.
- **ML Techniques**: Identified machine learning techniques that could be useful for the project, such as supervised learning (regression, classification), unsupervised learning (clustering), and deep learning (neural networks) for more advanced modeling. Discussed how these techniques can be applied to the project's goals 💡.

#### Day 5: Friday, 20/12/2024
- **Environment Setup**:  Tried and successfully installed the chosen IDE (PyCharm) after exploring the capabilities of other IDE's such as GitHub Codespaces for remote development or VSCode for it's powerful extension. Set up a virtual environment using Anaconda to isolate project dependencies and avoid conflicts.
- **Dependency Exploration**: Investigated and compared different versions of key libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Matplotlib) for optimal performance and compatibility with the project's requirements. Explored alternative libraries and dependencies for specific tasks, such as PDF processing libraries (e.g., PyPDF2, pdfminer) to determine the most suitable choices.

#### Day 6: Saturday, 21/12/2024
- **Weekend**
